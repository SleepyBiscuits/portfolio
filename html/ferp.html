							<h2 style="text-align: center;">Serious Games Prototype</h2>
							<p>The Flinders Escape Room Project was challenge for our team to create a VR Escape room game with puzzle-solving mechanics as well as serve the purpose of education.
								The core gameplay was a gamified virtual tour experience to anybody visiting Flinders Tonsley for the first time. They'd have to explore through the building and solve puzzles as they learn about the campus and its history.
							</p>
							<p>As an interaction design student, I mostly worked on gathering and editing the multimedia assets of the game, such as the 360 Photos and 3D Assets,
								while also dipping my toes into the prototyping and UI/UX Design.
								At the same time, I also collaborated with the team to brainstorm and develop the game's concept and mechanics.</p>

							<h2>Gameplay Summary</h2>
							
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="../images/ferp/ferpgame1.gif" alt="" />
							</span>
							<blockquote>
								FERP as a serious game serves as an onboarding experience for newcomers and visitors to the Flinders Tonsley Building through virtual reality. It used for the players to familiarise the featured locations and gain information. 
								<br/><br/>
								Along with the virtual tour is an escape room gameplay, where newcomers are challenged to solve through puzzles scattered around the areas. This embodies the core identity of a serious game, where gamification creates a sense of fun and relaxation during the learning process.
							</blockquote>
							
							<p>
								The player is able to navigate through several floors of the Tonsley campus using a teleportation-based movement system. Pressing buttons displayed within an area moves the player in that general direction. As the game is in VR players can freely look around, but also have the option to use the control sticks for smooth or snap turning.
							</p>
							<p>
								The player is able to find and pick up various items throughout Tonsley. Puzzles within the game largely revolve around using these items to figure out and enter various codes throughout the campus. Successfully completing these puzzles provides players with access to new areas, gradually opening up the campus over the course of the game.

							<p>For planning and research, we conducted a thorough research of similar existing games and simulations 
								to not only take inspiration, but also take note of the best practices for an effective simulation.
							This also to consider the appropriate methodologies that could consider this game for serious educational purpose.</p>

							<p> 
								The photos were gathered using a 360 camera on a pole to capture virtual tour camera shots of the campus with some shots edited on Adobe Photoshop to correct accidental shots (e.g. passerbys in the background).

							<h2>Literature Review and Research</h2>
							<h4>Gamification using Escape Rooms</h4>
							<blockquote>
								...They create a sense of fun and relaxation in the learning process, and thanks to their mysterious format, escape rooms subtly develop memory, perception, ability to concentrate and contribute to the overall development of students (Staneva et al., 2023).
								<br/><br/>
								A large proportion of research has emphasized these intrinsic motivational factors and students highly appreciated the gaming activity and expressed positive views (Makri et al., 2021).
								<br/><br/>
								Adopting a game-designed framework and well-defined design criteria and key pillars. This might lead to a game that more adequately meets the learning goals, adapts to educational learners’ needs, and focuses on key competencies for the target audience (Makri et al., 2021).
							</blockquote>
							<ul>	
								<li>Pedagogical aspects - game design has the main mission of forming new knowledge and serving as an aid in the learning process.</li>
								<li>Design aspects - as multimedia, an interactive product is created, it must meet certain design concepts and correspond to best practices in user experience. </li>
								<li>Aspects related to the content – the educational resource must be provided with the necessary theoretical base and opportunities for its sharing and assimilation. </li>
							(Staneva et al., 2023)
							</ul>
							

							<h4>Virtual Reality Tours</h4>
							<p>Objects and landmarks in virtual reality could be more easily remembered by the learners rather than the images presented with text on a PowerPoint slide or a printed page (Figueroa Jr, 2023).</blockquote>
							<h4>Theory of Multimedia Learning</h4>
							<p>Humans limit the amount of information they can process, and that information is processed via two channels: auditory and visual. Thus, providing coherent verbal and visual input to the learners reduces the cognitive load, enhancing learning (Figueroa Jr, 2023).</blockquote>
							<h4>Interactivity</h4>
							<p>Interactivity on the system compared to plain views on VR allowed students to candidly control the angle and content they want to see in the system... The system also guides  with audio instructions from the background...(Wu et al., 2021)</blockquote>
