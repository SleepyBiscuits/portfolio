							<h2 style="text-align: center;">Game Development project</h2>
							<p>The goal was to create a puzzle-themed platform game in unreal engine that our group could be proud of within 3 months.
								The project involved six team members with their own individual work to contribute to the game. 
								<br/>
								My role took up as the art director for the game's overall aesthetics and assets as well as the project manager thoroughly planning checking on member tasks in the alloted timeframe.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<h2>game summary</h2>
							
							 <!--insert gameplay here-->

							<blockquote>
								Ready to go on a wild goose chase? Well… chicken chase? Nibbles has once again caused a ruckus in your witch’s hut,
								causing your transmutation potion to explode! It’s not all bad, however, you have gained the ability to transform into several different animals. 
								Maneuverer your way through the wandering landscapes of Evimeria as you slither, hop, stomp and glide through the treacherous lands, 
								picking up the puzzle pieces needed to fix this mess and send these animals back to where they came from.
								But don’t think it’s going to be a walk in the park! These animals all have their different quirks and uses, so get experimenting and find the many ways to complete each level. 
								Sometimes all a person (or snake) needs is some out of the box thinking to tackle these challenges and you’ll eventually succeed and finally get some peace in quiet in your hut (if Nibbles stays out of it).
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								The overall objective of the game is to collect all the puzzle pieces to unlock the exit of the level. Each level will be split up into segments, 
								each segment will have a cauldron which will allow the player to swap between the different animals. It will be up to the player to pick an animal that best suits the obstacles in the upcoming platforms.  
							</p>

							
							
							<h2>aesthetics and Design</h2>
							<p>
								The overall appearance of the game is 32-bit pixels with design and animations to portray a cute witch and her transformations.
								The aesthetics lean into a cutesy art style like chibis along with magical and puzzle elements in a fantasy-based setting. 
								The environment would be set in a simple forest, in which the witch’s hut and cauldron resides. 
								The colour scheme would use bright hues and contrast with some darker tones to show any shadows and details.

								For the player character, I wanted to make a cute witch that would be able to transform into different animals. 
								I made use of Aseprite to create pixel art and animations to bring the player character and their transformations to life.
								Each sprite has its own unique abilities and animations to help the player traverse through the levels.
								For the UI, I wanted to keep it simple and easy to read, so I made use of a minimal pixel font and a minimal colour palette to stick with a classic retro aesthetic to the game.

							<p>The rest I didn't showcase happen to be free assets that I thought would fit our overall aesthetic,
